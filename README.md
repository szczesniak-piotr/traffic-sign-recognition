# General Info
* The program is written fully in Python language.
* The application is based on a Convolutional Neural Network.
* The dataset linked above contains 9 different preprocessed datasets, which are ready to use.

# Possible imporovements
* Augment the data, right now the application is only able to classify images which are in the right orientation and well cropped.
* Change the structure of the model, the one implemented is a very generic one, it serves its purpose and manages to achieve ~98% accuracy, but many parameters could be tweaked in order to make it better.
* Implement sign location detection in order to enable uploading uncropped images.
* Make use of a proper learning rate function.
